# Optical-Communication
 Optical-Communication simply Li-Fi communication (Light Fidelity) is an advanced technology that allows transferring data using optical communication such as visible light. Li-Fi data can travel through the light and then interpreted on the receiver side using any light-sensitive device like LDR or photodiode. Li-Fi communication can be 100 times faster than Wi-Fi.

Here in this project, we will be demonstrating Li-Fi communication using two Arduino. Here the text data is transmitted using LED. And it is decoded on the receiver side using LDR.
